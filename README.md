# 3 Months Of Front-End Development

Hello everyone! My name is Erick Torres, and I'm an aspiring Software Engineer. My goal is to make this repository into a fully functional portfolio website. I have done other projects in the past, such as creating landing pages and a social media mockup page.

I am currently learning React.js, and I hope to incorporate it into this project once I am skilled enough. With that said, this will be a journal of sorts for the next three months as I work toward mastering Front-End development. Perhaps after this, I'll make a "Three Months of Back-End Development." I plan to add a new text entry to this `README.md` file every week with updates on things I have learned or things I find interesting in my journey.
## Project Goals

* **Month 1: Foundations in HTML, CSS, and Basic JavaScript**
  * CSS Flexbox and Grid Basics, Responsive Design Concepts
  * **(Project 1)** Build a responsive landing page using Flexbox and Grid.
  * CSS Transitions, Animations, Pseudo-Classes, and Pseudo-Elements
  * JavaScript Basics: Variables, Data Types, Conditionals, Loops, and Functions
  * **(Project 2)** Create an interactive photo gallery with CSS animations and JavaScript to toggle image details on click.
  * Practice DOM manipulation (`getElementById`, `querySelector`, etc.) and events (`click`, `mouseover`)
  * Introduction to arrays and objects in JavaScript; use them to manage data on the page
  * **(Project 3)** Build a simple to-do list where users can add, delete, and mark tasks as completed
  * Deepen understanding of JavaScript functions, scope, and closures.
  * Work with Local Storage to save and load data across sessions
  * **(Project 4)** Create a budget tracker that saves income and expenses to Local Storage.

* **Month 2: Advanced JavaScript Concepts**
  * Review ES6 Syntax: `let`, `const`, arrow functions, template literals
  * Practice array methods (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`, `forEach`) and how they can simplify data manipulation
  * **(Project 5)** Build a product catalog where users can filter and search items using array methods
  * Learn the basics of OOP: classes, constructors, methods, inheritance
  * **(Project 6)** Build a library app where users can add, view, and delete book entries, using classes to create and manage each book
  * Learn about asynchronous JavaScript: callbacks, promises, and async/await
  * Practice fetching data from public APIs using `fetch()` and handling responses
  * **(Project 7)** Create a weather app that fetches real-time weather data from a public API based on user location
  * Explore JavaScript modules (`import`/`export`) and why modular code is useful
  * Set up a bundler like Webpack or Vite to organize and bundle files
  * **(Project 8)** Refactor the budget tracker or to-do list from Month 1 to use JavaScript modules

* **Month 3: React and Application Development**
  * Set up a React app using `create-react-app` or Vite. Learn components, JSX, and props.
  * Practice passing data between components using props and rendering lists.
  * **(Project 9)** Create a contact list app with React, where each contact is displayed as a component.
  * Introduction to React's `useState` hook and managing component state
  * Lift state up to parent components and practice two-way data binding
  * **(Project 10)** Build a task manager app where users can add, edit, and delete tasks using state
  * Learn about controlled components and form handling in React
  * Practice validation and submission with React forms
  * **(Project 11)** Create a login and registration form with React that validates user input
  * Set up React Router for multi-page navigation, creating routes and links between pages
  * Review React concepts from previous weeks, with extra focus on complex components or state management as needed
  * **(FINAL Project)** Build a portfolio site using React, with pages for About Me, Projects, Contact, and any other necessary sections. Incorporate React Router for navigation and some interactive features.

I will update this `README.md` file every week with insights and progress. Follow along to see how I grow my skills in front-end development!
